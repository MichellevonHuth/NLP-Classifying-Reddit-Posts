# Reddit Post Classification Project

## Overview

Welcome to our Reddit Post Classification project! This repository contains the code and documentation for a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on classifying mental health-related posts on Reddit. The project is a collaborative effort by the M4 group as part of the MSc Business Administration and Data Science program at Copenhagen Business School.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project comprises over 700,000 posts from various mental health subreddits. The data was obtained from Kaggle, created using the official Reddit API and PushShift API.

## Project Title

**Classifying Mental Health Posts on Reddit: A Comparative Study of Tf-Idf and Word2Vec Embeddings**

## Report

The detailed report is included in the repository. The report delves into the motivation, methodology, and findings of the study, emphasizing the impact of tf-idf and Word2Vec embeddings on classification models.


## How to Use

To reproduce the results or extend the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/NLP-Classifying-Reddit-Posts.git
    ```

2. Set up your Python environment with the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Explore the code in the `code` directory to understand the implementation of Logistic Regression and Multi-Layer Perceptron models.

4. Use the provided dataset or replace it with your own dataset, ensuring it follows the same structure.

5. Run the Python scripts to train and evaluate the models.

## Conclusion

This project contributes to the field of Natural Language Processing by addressing the challenge of classifying mental health-related posts on Reddit. By comparing the impact of tf-idf and Word2Vec embeddings, our study aims to enhance user interactions and support within the Reddit community.
